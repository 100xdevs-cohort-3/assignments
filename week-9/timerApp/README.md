# Timer App in React

## Objective  
Build a simple timer app with start, pause, reset, and editable time functionality.

---

## Steps:

### 1. **State Management**
   - Use `useState` to track:
     - `time` (in seconds)
     - `isRunning` (timer status)
     - `editState` (for tracking the field being edited and its value)

### 2. **Countdown Logic**
   - Implement a `useEffect` that updates the `time` every second when the timer is active.

### 3. **Editable Time**
   - Allow users to click on hours, minutes, or seconds to edit that specific part of the time.

### 4. **Input Handling**
   - Ensure inputs are limited to two digits (hours, minutes, seconds).

### 5. **Controls**
   - Provide buttons for:
     - Starting/pausing the timer.
     - Resetting the timer.

## Core Functions:

### `handleEditField(field)`
**Signature:**
```js
const handleEditField = (field: string) => void
```

**Description:**
This function handles the edit operation of the hours, minutes, or seconds fields:
- If the field being edited is clicked again (i.e., `editState.field === field`), it saves the new value (with leading zeros if needed), calculates the new total time in seconds, and updates the `time` and `initialTime`.
- If the field is clicked for the first time, it pauses the timer and prepares the value for editing (removes leading zeros).

### 6. **Steps in `handleEditField`:**
1. **Check if field is being edited:**
   - If `editState.field === field`, this means the user has finished editing that field. We calculate and save the new value.
   
2. **Update time:**
   - We use the helper function `calculateTime` to calculate the new total time in seconds based on the edited hours, minutes, and seconds.

3. **Reset editing state:**
   - After saving the new value, we reset the editing state to `null`, indicating no field is being edited.

4. **Start editing the field:**
   - If the field was not previously being edited, pause the timer and display an input field for editing.

### **Example:**
```js
const newTime = {
  ...formatTime(time), 
  [field]: editState.value.padStart(2, '0') // Add leading zeros if necessary
};

const calculatedTime = calculateTime(newTime.hours, newTime.minutes, newTime.seconds);
```

### `calculateTime(hours, minutes, seconds)`
**Signature:**
```js
const calculateTime = (hours: string, minutes: string, seconds: string) => number
```

**Description:**
This function calculates the total time in seconds based on the given `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`. If any of these values are invalid (i.e., `NaN`), it returns `0`.

### **Steps in `calculateTime`:**
1. Parse the hours, minutes, and seconds.
2. Convert hours to seconds (hours * 3600), minutes to seconds (minutes * 60), and add the seconds.
3. Check if the result is `NaN` (i.e., invalid input). If it is, return `0`; otherwise, return the calculated time.

### **Example:**
```js
const calculatedTime = 
  parseInt(hours) * 3600 + 
  parseInt(minutes) * 60 + 
  parseInt(seconds);
```

## Auxiliary Functions:

### 1. `formatTime(time: number): { hours: string, minutes: string, seconds: string }`
**Purpose:**
Formats the given `time` (in seconds) into hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit is always displayed as two digits (with leading zeros if necessary).

**Example:**
For `time = 3661`, the result would be `{ hours: '01', minutes: '01', seconds: '01' }`.

### Conclusion:

This React Timer App provides:
- Real-time countdown functionality.
- Editable time with input validation.
- Clear and simple UI for user interaction.

You can extend this timer app by adding features such as time limits, alarms, or styling improvements.
