# Pet Adoption Form - React Project

Build a simple React app where users can fill out a pet adoption form and view the data in a table.

## Overview

The app has three main parts:

1. **Header**: Displays the appâ€™s title.
2. **Form**: Users fill in details like name, contact info, and pet preferences.
3. **Table**: Shows the submitted form data after submission.

## Learning Goals

- Build React components (Header, Form, Table).
- Use `useState` to manage form input and state.
- Pass data between components using props.

### Bonus Challenge (Optional)

- **Custom Form Validation**: Enhance the form by adding custom validation functions. For example:
  - Validate that the pet name, breed, and adopter's name fields have a minimum length (e.g., 3 characters).
  - Ensure the email is in a valid format (e.g., using a regex).
  - Check that the phone number is a valid 10-digit number.
  - Add validation that runs on the `onChange` event to give users real-time feedback while typing.

This is a great opportunity to test your JavaScript skills and improve form handling in React!
