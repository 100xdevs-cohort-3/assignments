Your logic is like a doctor

You need to create 4 routes (4 things that the hospital can do)

1. GET - User can check how many kidneys they have and their health
2. POST - User can add a new kidney
3. PUT - User can replace a kidney, make it healthy
4. DELETE - User can remove a kidney

-   What should happen if they try to delete when there are no kidneys?
-   What should happen if they try to make a kidney healthy when all are already healthy?
